# Restaurant Page

This project is part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com) Advanced JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming curriculum. The goal is to build a dynamically rendered restaurant page using modern JavaScript and best practices.

## Learning Objectives

Through this project, I will deepen my understanding of:

- **Webpack** for bundling and optimizing code
- **JavaScript Modules** to organize and manage functionality
- **Event Listeners** for interactivity

## Features

- Dynamically generated content for a restaurant website
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+) features for clean and efficient code structure

## Live Demo

A live demo will be added soon.
